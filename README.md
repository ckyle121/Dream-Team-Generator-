# Dream Team Generator

The Team Profile Generator is a command-line-input application run in Node that requests information from the user about members of an engineering team and generates an HTML file displaying that information. Before running the application the user must perform an npm install to install all required dependencies.

This app was created using Object-Oriented Programming concepts, using classes and constructors to create "team member" objects based on information entered by the user. The app is run using Node.js, and uses the "Inquirer" and "FS" node modules. Files for different objects are also stored in separate .js files and passed among one another using module.exports and require.

Below is an example of Node Prompts run in the terminal and the example file output created using the answers to the prompted questions.
